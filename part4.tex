\section{Learning process of survey papers search and review}

The learning process for this assignment was quite interesting and, in my opinion, will help a lot in a real world research to write a survey paper in my area. The steps I followed to build this assignment, together with the subjects I saw in class about survey papers, how to identify and write good ones, helped me understand how to start to write such kind of paper.

The definition of the research area, then the search for papers, browsing and scanning interesting ones related to the area, then critically/creatively reading some selected ones and analysing why they were more cited or not helped me get the ``lay of the land'' of survey papers. I believe after this assignment I am more prepared to start writing my first survey paper in my research area and have a successful publication.
