## Assignment description

Describe your learning/process so far on the survey paper.  

In this step you are to "Get the lay of the land" before you do your own survey.  State an initial research direction. This week you are to “search” for survey papers in that area and your journal should list all those you find that are less than 7 years old and modestly related to your topic.    If there are no related papers, you either are weak at searching or defined too narrow an area.  You need to find at least 5, but ideally 10-15 of the most relevant. 

Critically/creatively read at least 5 survey papers, putting at 1/2 page of notes in your journal for each. One of those must be the most cited, and one should low cited paper at least three years old.  Your critical read should address some key elements of a survey paper we discussed in class.    Your journal should also discuss why you think the highly cited paper is highly cited and why the other is not. 

Finally,  build a topic map of where there are gaps. Use as many of the surveys as you found,  and discuss what you learned about the gaps and possible directions for a survey paper that has some novelty. 

Make your overleaf latex file into a public git-repo and include a link to the repo in the journal.   Don't invite me or put the link in Canvas.
