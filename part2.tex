\section{Critically/creatively read survey papers}

I selected these 5 papers to critically/creatively read for this assignment:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \cite{oluwadare2019overview} An overview of methods for reconstructing 3-D chromosome and genome structures from Hi-C data.
    \item \cite{mackay2020computational} Computational methods for predicting 3D genomic organization from high-resolution chromosome conformation capture data.
    \item \cite{zhou20213d} The 3D genome structure of single cells.
    \item \cite{zhang2020advances} Advances in technologies for 3D genomics research.
    \item \cite{ulianov2022two} The two waves in single-cell 3D genomics.
\end{enumerate}
